v0.2.0
------
- Deprecated BDAnimationModules
- Bundled a new plugin, DeployableEngines, which does the things that BDAnimationModules did
- Added situation masks to contract parameters
- Fuel tanks containing LiquidHydrogen are now split into lifting tanks and insulated tanks
- Lifting tanks are all standard stock fuel tanks
- Lifting tanks have good mass ratios, but LiquidHydrogen contained in them boils away over time
- Insulated tanks are the large gold foil tanks that used to be in NF Propulsion
- Insulated tanks have poor mass ratios, but consume ElectricCharge to stop the LiquidHydrogen from evaporating
- Changes to the base masses, mix ratios and capacities of LiquidHydrogen tanks
