========================
CRYOGENIC ENGINES v0.1.9
========================

This is a pack with several high efficiency engines that run on Liquid Hydrogen and Oxidizer. They tend to be more expensive and have less thrust than their LF/O counterparts. Also included are patches that allow all stock fuel tanks to contain the appropriate resources. 

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

If you want your engines to use LF/O instead of LH2/O, drop the CryoEnginesLFO folder (found in the Extras folder in this archive) into your KSP GameData folder.
