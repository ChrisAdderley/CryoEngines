	description = Affectionately known as the 'happy birthday tank' among the KSC staff. Responsible for 57 injuries when an engineer attempted to use a filled article as a cake - complete with candles. Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
