	description = A large liquid hydrogen tank. Not particularly solid, but critic reviews include the words "stunning", "enormous" and "leaky". Wait, was I supposed to say that? Due to regressions in plumbing technology, you may need to run a fuel line from this tank to get its "fuel" potential. Uses insulation and cooling systems to stop cryogenic fuels like liquid hydrogen from escaping the tank.
